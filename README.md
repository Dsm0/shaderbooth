# Shaderbooth

Shaderbooth is a browser based editing environment for writing and sharing face filter artworks, based on fragment shaders and realtime facial landmark data.

Face detection uses TensorFlow.js [Facemesh](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/facemesh).

and motivated by a frustration with walled gardens like those Spark AR instagram filters!

Todo:

localstorage persist (& reset button?)
improve errors
codemirror hints/suggestions
timeout to fade code away
view-mode for mobile

backend:
browse examples
upload function
hotlinkable

future:
provide glsl functions
background subtraction.
pass in more landmarks to shader.
GPU based paint.js?
custom textures, texture editor
